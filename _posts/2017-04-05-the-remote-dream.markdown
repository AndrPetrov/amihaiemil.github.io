preview: A brief explanation of what I understand by the words "remote work"
---

Ever since I started contributing to opensource and more notably since I started
sharing articles on LinkedIn, HR people are contacting me with remote work
opportunities. Besides that, I usually keep an eye open for companies offering this kind
of employment.

The job descriptions always sound interesting, especially when focusing
on work/family balance, but what bothers me is that they always contain the following
three statements (expressed in one way or another):
"working from home", "full-time" and "attending Skype calls or video meetings"

I personally see absolutely no difference between an offer like the ones described above
and one that requires you to be in the office from 9 to 5. I would even
say that the office is a better alternative.

Where is the gained value? Maybe you save 1h a day because you don't have to actually go
in the office. Other than that, the picture I have in mind is rather sad: sitting 8h in front
of your laptop alone, while your kids are at school and your wife at work. Communication with your
colleagues becomes a lot harder because you are not close to one another. Add the motivation issue to all this:
anyone sitting on their couch or at 10 feet from their bed is less enclined to be productive
than someone sitting in an office. And, who knows, maybe you stumble across an employer who decides
that it's a good and ethical idea to install keyloggers and printscreen software on your machine.

My point is that this kind of remote work is **an illusion**, a well crafted lie.
Chances are that it's a much more stressful way of working and surely you don't have more freedom. Again -- being glued
to a desk or to a couch is the same thing. I hope I don't need to tell you that no one has ever opened their laptop at the beach,
under a palm tree and started working remotely.

Here are the real problems: 1) full-time, commited, schedule and 2) meetings and calls with the colleagues. As long as you
have one of these two, you will be nowhere near the advertised freedom. I assume the full-time part is already clear, so
here's what I don't like about having to meet and/or call my colleagues: I have to wrap my schedule around it; I cannot do anything on
Tuesdays because at 2pm I have to attend one of those useless, money-milking meetings. I also cannot rely on a Thursday,
without my laptop, because my phone will most likely ring: "Hey, could you help us a litte, Joe does not understand what you did here..."

What is the solution? A freelancer-client relationship, rather than an employee-employer one.
But I'm not talking about a classical one where someone hires a consultant, they spend hours
discussing, making plans and comming up with some blunt requirements. I, as a developer, expect
to come to you and hear something like: **"Please, implement this method and unit test it"**, instead of
"I have this idea of an application and bla bla bla". If you don't have a clear project, with a well-defined
set of tasks, then we'll inevitably end up in a "long-term relationship", which translates to fake remote work.

In order for work to be truly remote, the project has to be split up in many tiny pieces,
tasks that any developer could implement fast! The ideal workflow is as follows:

   * I get an email containing the task;
   * I provide the solution;
   * I get an email from PayPal that payment has arrived for said task;
   * End of story;

Now, when I have more time, I might take on more such tasks or leave them to other developers if I don't feel like solving them.
Since the tasks are small, I do not become a 'God' for that project -- the client doesn't suffer from my absence,
he simply forwards the task to another developer.

This is pretty much what I would expect from a remote client. If I had ten or fifteen such clients,
I would be the happiest developer, but unfortunately <a href="http://www.teamed.io">Teamed/a> is the only
company with such a workflow, that I could find so far. Do you happen to know other similar companies?
