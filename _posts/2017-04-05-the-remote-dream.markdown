preview: A brief explanation of what I understand by the words "remote work"
---

Ever since I started contributing to opensource and more notably since I started
sharing articles on LinkedIn, HR people are contacting me with remote work
opportunities. Besides that, I usually keep an eye open for companies offering this kind
of employment.

The job descriptions always sound interesting, especially when focusing
on work/family balance, but what bothers me is that they always contain the following
three statements (expressed in one way or another):
"working from home", "full-time" and "attending skype calls or video meetings"

I personally see absolutely no difference between an offer like the ones described above
and a traditional one that would require you to be in the office from 9 to 5. I would even
say that the office is a better alternative.
