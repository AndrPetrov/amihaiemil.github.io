preview: A brief explanation of what I understand by the words "remote work"
---

Ever since I started contributing to opensource and more notably since I started
sharing articles on LinkedIn, HR people are contacting me with remote work
opportunities. Besides that, I usually keep an eye open for companies offering this kind
of employment.

The job descriptions always sound interesting, especially when focusing
on work/family balance, but what bothers me is that they always contain the following
three statements (expressed in one way or another):
"working from home", "full-time" and "attending skype calls or video meetings"

I personally see absolutely no difference between an offer like the ones described above
and a traditional one that would require you to be in the office from 9 to 5. I would even
say that the office is a better alternative.

Where is the gained value? Maybe you save 1h a day because you don't have to actually go
in the office. Other than that, the picture I have in mind is rather sad: sitting 8h in front
of your laptop, all alone, while your kids are at school and your wife at work. Communication with your
colleagues becomes a lot harder because you are not close to one another. Add the motivation issue to all this:
anyone sitting on their couch or at 10 feet from their bed is less enclined to be productive
than someone sitting in an office -- who knows, maybe you stumble across an employer who decides
that it's a good and ethical idea to install keyloggers and printscreen software on your machine.

My point here is that this kind of remote work is **an illusion**, a well crafted lie.
Chances are that it's a much more stressful way of working and surely you don't have more freedom. Again -- being glued
to a desk or to a couch is the same thing. I hope I don't need to tell you that no one has ever opened their laptop at the beach,
under a palm tree and started working remotely.

Here are the real problems: 1) full-time, commited, schedule and 2) meetings and calls with the colleagues. As long as you
have one of these two, you will be nowhere near the advertised freedom. I assume the full-time part is already clear, so
here's what I don't like about having to meet and/or call my colleagues: I have to wrap my schedule around it; I cannot do anything on
Tuesdays because at 2pm I have to attend one of those useless, money-milking meetings. I also cannot rely on a chilled Thursday,
without my laptop, because my phone will most likely ring ring: "Hey, could you help us a litte, Joe does not understand what you did here..."

What is the solution? A freelancer-client relationship, rather than an employee-employer one.
