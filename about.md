My name is Mihai Andronache and I am a Java developer. I have a Bachelor's degree in CS from [BBU](http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/en/), Cluj-Napoca.

I'm contributing to opensource and writing this blog because I find it a good way to get rid of the office job routine, learn new things and keep my knowledge updated.

I also publich articles on [Baeldung](http://www.baeldung.com/author/mihaiandronache/). Check them out as well, comment, let me know what you think!
