My name is Mihai Andronache and I am a Java developer. I have a Bachelor's degree in CS from [BBU](http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/en/), Cluj-Napoca.

I recently started contributing to open source and decided to start writing this blog. For me, this is a way of getting rid of the office job routine, learn new things and keep my knowledge updated.

Follow me on Twitter and Github to see my latest activity.
