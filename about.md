My name is Mihai Andronache and I am a Java developer. I have a Bachelor's degree in cs from [BBU](http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/en/), Cluj-Napoca.

I recently started contributing to open source and decided to start writing this blog. For me, this is a way of getting rid of the boring office job routine, learn new things and keep my knowledge updated.

Feel free to follow me on Twitter and Github to see my latest activity.
